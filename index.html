      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
      <p>We are all actors, some stage like some screen like. If you’re late
      for work and the barista at Starbucks is slow making your coffee, the
      introverts (“the screen like”) among us would call various face muscles
      into action to communicate the rush we’re in. The extroverts among us
      often adapt “stage like” acting to fulfill their desires. For example
      if your child is misbehaving at Disneyland what better way to correct
      them than to evoke the attention and support of nearby holidaymakers
      by roaring “Bums are for seats, not the ground!"</p>
